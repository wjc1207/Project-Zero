# Project-Zero

### Young people's first embedded system project

The ESP32 Audio Board is a MP3 with strong power. It has a microphone, a 128x64 OLED screen, a stereo speaker, a light sensor, a proximity sensor, an accelerometer, a SD card slot and 3 buttons.

### How to get one?

1. download the relative PCB documents from [here](https://github.com/wjc74751/Project-Zero/tree/main/PCB) (I will recommend the AD version)
2. get the PCB from the PCB maker like JLC
3. buy the relative components from the online shopping platform like Taobao
4. Solder PCBs and components
5. upload the relative code to the MP3 and enjoy

### advantage

cool!

### problems

cannot upload the code to the ESP32 Board when it is installed on the bottom board. You need to uninstall the ESP32 Board from the bottom board and then upload the code.
