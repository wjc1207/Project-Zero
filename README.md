### why should you get one?

1. Learning Opportunity: The ESP32 Audio Board provides an excellent opportunity for young people to dive into the world of embedded systems and gain hands-on experience in building and programming their own device. It allows them to understand the fundamentals of circuit design, soldering, and coding.

2. Versatility: The board offers a wide range of functions and features, including a microphone, OLED screen, stereo speaker, light sensor, proximity sensor, accelerometer, SD card slot, and buttons. This versatility enables users to explore various applications and experiment with different functionalities.

3. MP3 Capability: The ESP32 Audio Board is equipped with MP3 capabilities, allowing users to play and pause music, switch to the previous or next track, and adjust the volume. This makes it a convenient and compact music player that can be used in everyday scenarios.

4. Integrated Sensors: With seven built-in sensors, including the light sensor, proximity sensor, and accelerometer, the board offers the opportunity to develop projects that involve environmental sensing, motion detection, and interactive applications. This opens up possibilities for creating unique and engaging projects.

5. Affordable: The ESP32 Audio Board is a cost-effective option for a project board, making it accessible to young people who may have limited budgets. It provides an affordable way to explore the world of embedded systems without breaking the bank.

6. Community and Support: The ESP32 platform has a large and active community of developers and enthusiasts. This means that there are plenty of resources, tutorials, and online forums available to support young people in their learning journey. They can seek guidance, ask questions, and share their projects with others who have similar interests.

By getting the ESP32 Audio Board, young people can embark on an exciting project that combines creativity, technical skills, and practical application. It offers a platform to learn, experiment, and showcase their abilities in building their own embedded system.

### How to get one?

1. download the relative PCB documents from [here](https://github.com/wjc74751/Project-Zero/tree/main/PCB) (I will recommend the AD version)
2. get the PCB from the PCB maker like JLC
3. buy the relative components from the online shopping platform like Taobao
4. Solder PCBs and components
5. upload the relative code to the MP3 and enjoy

### advantage

1. cool
2. cheap
3. mutiple sensors (7)

### problems

When the ESP32 Board is installed on the bottom board, the code can not be uploaded. You need to uninstall it to upload the code to it.
