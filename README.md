### its Functions

It has functions of play and pause, change to the pervious/next music, adjust the music volume. 

### How to get one?

1. download the relative PCB documents from [here](https://github.com/wjc74751/Project-Zero/tree/main/PCB) (I will recommend the AD version)
2. get the PCB from the PCB maker like JLC
3. buy the relative components from the online shopping platform like Taobao
4. Solder PCBs and components
5. upload the relative code to the MP3 and enjoy

### advantage

cool!

### problems

When the ESP32 Board is installed on the bottom board, the code can not be uploaded. You need to uninstall it to upload the code to it.
